                listen
                on the social networks influence our opinions.</p>

                was created to help you analyze tweets of your friends and tries to measure toxicity of their
                language. That means that it takes tweets of users you follow and <a href="https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi" target="_blank">Perspective API</a> determines toxicity of
                their
